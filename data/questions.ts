        "points": 10,
        "feedback": "Great job! Updating your systems as soon as updates are available is like locking your doors every night—it keeps hackers out by fixing security holes they could use to break in. Cybercriminals are always looking for outdated systems to exploit, like in the WannaCry attack of 2017, which hit businesses that hadn’t updated in just a few weeks. By staying current, you’re making it much harder for them to get in. To keep this habit strong:\n\n- **Enable Automatic Updates**: On Windows, go to Settings > Update & Security > Windows Update > Advanced Options and turn on 'Automatically download updates.' On a Mac, go to System Preferences > Software Update and check 'Automatically keep my Mac up to date.' This ensures updates happen without you lifting a finger.\n- **Set Active Hours**: Avoid interruptions by setting update times for when you’re not working. On Windows, in 'Windows Update,' click 'Change active hours' and pick something like 10 PM to 6 AM.\n- **Check Monthly**: Set a calendar reminder for the first of each month to peek at your update history (Windows: 'View update history'; Mac: 'More info' in Software Update). If updates are recent, you’re golden—if not, troubleshoot or call your internet provider.\n\nYou’re already doing one of the smartest things to protect your business. Keep it up, and you’ll stay ahead of the bad guys!"

        "feedback": "You’re making an effort, which is a good start, but waiting 1-3 months to update your systems is like leaving your shop’s back door unlocked for weeks—someone’s bound to notice and sneak in. Hackers move fast, often exploiting flaws within days of discovery. Take the WannaCry ransomware attack in 2017—it locked up thousands of businesses worldwide because they hadn’t updated their Windows systems in just a few weeks, costing millions. Updating only every few months leaves your business exposed to these kinds of attacks, and doing it manually 'when you have time' can easily slip when you’re busy.\n\n**Steps to Fix This**:\n1. **Switch to Automatic Updates**: Let your systems handle it. On Windows, click Start, type 'Settings,' go to 'Update & Security > Windows Update > Advanced Options,' and turn on 'Automatically download updates.' On a Mac, go to 'System Preferences > Software Update' and check 'Automatically keep my Mac up to date.'\n2. **Set a Quiet Time**: Schedule updates for off-hours. On Windows, under 'Windows Update,' click 'Change active hours' and set 10 PM to 6 AM. Macs usually update overnight.\n3. **Check Monthly**: Once a month, look at your update history (Windows: 'View update history'; Mac: 'More info' in Software Update) to ensure it’s working. If updates are old, troubleshoot or call your provider.\n4. **Catch Up Now**: Manually check for updates today—click 'Check for updates' in the same menu and install anything pending. It might take 15-20 minutes.\n5. **Get Help if Stuck**: If this feels tricky, your internet provider or a local tech shop can set it up over the phone or in person.\n\nSwitching to automatic updates takes this off your plate and keeps your systems secure without the wait. You’ve got this!"

        "feedback": "This approach is risky! Waiting until there’s a problem or your computer forces an update is like ignoring a leaky roof until it rains—you’re already in trouble by then. Your operating system is the backbone of your digital security, and skipping updates leaves it wide open to hackers. For example, the Equifax breach in 2017 exposed 147 million people’s data because they didn’t update software for months after a fix was available—it was a disaster they could’ve avoided. Ransomware doesn’t wait for 'someday'—it locks files and demands payment daily. If you only update when forced, you’re an easy target, and a problem might mean you’ve already been hit.\n\n**Steps to Fix This**:\n1. **Turn On Automatic Updates**: Do it now—on Windows, go to Settings > Update & Security > Windows Update > Advanced Options and enable 'Automatically download updates.' On a Mac, System Preferences > Software Update > check 'Automatically keep my Mac up to date.'\n2. **Schedule It**: Set updates for off-hours. On Windows, use 'Change active hours' to pick midnight to 8 AM. Macs handle it overnight.\n3. **Check Now**: Go to 'Windows Update' or 'Software Update,' click 'Check for updates,' and install anything waiting—save your work first, as it might restart.\n4. **Monitor Monthly**: Set a reminder to glance at your update history monthly. If it’s not current, fix it or call for help.\n5. **Ask for Support**: If this feels overwhelming, your internet provider’s support line (usually free) or a tech shop can walk you through it.\n\nTaking these steps turns your systems from sitting ducks into tough targets. It’s easier than you think, and you’ll feel much safer!"

Updates are your first line of defense against cyberattacks, and uncertainty often means gaps hackers can exploit. The good news? It’s simple to find out and fix!\n\n**Steps to Fix This**:\n1. **Check Your Settings**: On Windows, go to Settings > Update & Security > Windows Update—look for 'Last checked' or 'Update history.' If it’s over a week old, updates might not be automatic. On a Mac, System Preferences > Software Update will say if you’re up to date.\n2. **Enable Automatic Updates**: If they’re off, turn them on—Windows: 'Advanced Options > Automatically download updates'; Mac: 'Automatically keep my Mac up to date.'\n3. **Ask for Help**: If you have an IT person, call and ask, 'Are our systems set to update automatically?' If not, have them fix it.\n4. **Take Charge**: If you manage your own PCs, set a monthly reminder to check update history and ensure it’s working.\n\nGetting a handle on updates is like locking your doors at night—a small step with big protection.

Apps like Chrome or Zoom can have security flaws too, and staying current shuts those doors tight. For example, Zoom fixed a flaw in 2020 that let hackers crash meetings—updates stopped it cold. To keep this smooth:\n\n- **Enable Auto-Updates**: For Chrome, it updates itself—check by clicking the three dots > Help > About Google Chrome. For Zoom, go to Settings > General and check 'Automatically keep Zoom up to date.' Adobe Reader: Help > Check for Updates > set to automatic.\n- **Use a Tool**: Try Ninite (search 'Ninite')—it’s free and updates multiple apps in one go.\n- **Check Quarterly**: Set a reminder every 3 months to ensure all apps are current and auto-updates are working.\n\nYou’re doing a fantastic job keeping your business secure—keep it up, and you’ll stay one step ahead!"

        "feedback": "This is risky! Writing passwords down or saving them in a file—like a Word doc or spreadsheet—is like hiding your keys under the doormat. If someone gets into your office, they could snatch that paper list. Worse, if a hacker gets into your computer (via phishing or outdated software), they’d hit the jackpot with that file—access to banking, email, everything. In 2019, a medical practice got hacked because an employee’s password list was in a desktop file; patient data was stolen, and it was a mess. Even trusted staff could accidentally misuse it, and paper or files don’t help you create strong passwords—they’re often weak and reused.\n\n**Steps to Fix This**:\n1. **Get a Password Manager**: Download a free one like Bitwarden or LastPass (search 'Bitwarden download')—it’s quick to install.\n2. **Set It Up**: Create a master password—long and memorable (e.g., 'MyDogRuns2Fast!'). Write it down temporarily and lock it away until memorized.\n3. **Transfer Passwords**: Open your list or file, log into each account, and use the manager’s 'generate password' to make a new one (e.g., 'P7!kQz9$mL2'). Save it in the manager.\n4. **Delete Old Records**: Shred paper lists. For files, right-click > Delete, then empty Recycle Bin (Windows) or Trash (Mac).\n5. **Share Smart**: Use the manager’s 'share' feature for team access—no more emails.\n6. **Add 2FA**: In the manager’s settings, enable two-factor authentication for extra safety.\n\nSwitching to a password manager is like upgrading to a vault—it’s safer and simpler.

Emails can be intercepted, and messages aren’t secure. In 2020, a business lost their social media because an employee shared a password via WhatsApp, and a hacker grabbed it. This setup is a hacker’s dream.\n\n**Steps to Fix This**:\n1. **Get a Password Manager**: Download Bitwarden or LastPass for free—it’s your new password vault.\n2. **Generate Strong Passwords**: For each account, use the manager to create a unique one (e.g., 'X9!pQz7$kM2') and save it.\n3. **Stop Unsafe Sharing**: Never email or message passwords—use the manager’s 'share' feature or hand-deliver on paper (then shred).\n4. **Add 2FA**: For key accounts (email, banking), enable two-factor authentication in security settings—it’s like a deadbolt.\n5. **Train Your Team**: Share this risk with employees—show them how to use the manager with a test account.\n\nMaking these changes locks down your accounts tight—it’s a quick fix with huge payoff.
